# React Component Embeddable Widget Pipeline Prototype

## Goal

Implement and test an initial working prototype of the React component to embeddable third-party widget pipeline using [`FloatingWidget`](/components/widgets/floating-widget/floating-widget.tsx) as the target component to transform, bundle, and embed as a widget.

## Widget Documentation

- [`PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`](/docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md) *(likely outdated)*
- [`PROJECT-CONCEPTS.md`](/docs/PROJECT-CONCEPTS.md)
- [`PROJECT-REVIEW.md`](/docs/PROJECT-REVIEW.md) *(likely outdated)*
- [`react-widget-architecture-docs.md`](/docs/react-widget-architecture-docs.md) (initial architecture & designs)
- [`ui-ux-platform-concepts.md`](/docs/ui-ux-platform-concepts.md) (initial concepts & research)
- [`PLAN.md`](/docs/PLAN.md) *(outdated)*

## Widget Code

- `app/`
  - `globals.css`
- `components/`
  - `ask-anything/`: Core UI components to use in widget components
    - `ask-button.tsx`
    - `answer-card.tsx`
  - `widgets/`
    - `floating-widget/`
      - `floating-widget-button.tsx`
      - `floating-widget-card.tsx`
      - `floating-widget.tsx`: Core `FloatingWidget` component (widget)
- `widgets/`
  - `types.ts`: Core widget types
  - `widget-manager.tsx`: Core `WidgetManager` class
- `scripts/`
  - `build.widget.ts`: Widget build script
  - `initialize.widget.ts`: Widget initialization script

## Instructions

- Review the project at a high-level
- Review all widget-related [documentation](#widget-documentation) and [code](#widget-code):
  - Gain full understanding of React component widget pipeline and project intent
  - Decide if current widget architecture, designs, and code implementations require updates or fixes
  - Plan out necessary updates and fixes
- Update code implementions as needed
- Run widget build script and ensure proper building/bundling of `FloatingWidget` component into embeddable widget:
  - Note any errors
- Embed the built `FloatingWidget` widget on the `Widgets` page (`/widgets`) for browser testing and demonstration:
  - Test rendering of embedded `FloatingWidget`
  - Note any errors
- Write documentation (in a single new markdown document in `docs/`):
  - Summary of pipeline prototype implementation work done
  - Plans for testing
  - Next steps

Before responding, please:
1. Decompose the request into core components
2. Identify any ambiguities that need clarification
3. Create a structured approach to address each component
4. Validate your understanding before proceeding

## Success Criteria

Successful implementation of this widget pipeline prototype includes the following:
- Built `FloatingWidget` as an embeddable third-party widget with optimal bundling, style isolation, etc.
- Embedded `FloatingWidget` properly rendered in [`/widgets`](/app/widgets/page.tsx) with no errors
