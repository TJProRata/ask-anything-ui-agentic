# Development Roadmap

## Current Status

The Ask Anything UI widget pipeline is functionally complete with Shadow DOM isolation, IIFE bundling, and theme support. This roadmap outlines the next phases of development to enhance functionality and prepare for production deployment.

## Phase 1: Performance & Optimization (Current Focus)

### Goals
- Reduce bundle size below 200KB
- Optimize runtime performance
- Improve loading experience

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement code splitting for widget components
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical features
- [ ] Optimize React bundle with production build flags
- [ ] Implement CSS tree-shaking for widget styles
- [ ] Add resource hints and preloading strategies

### Metrics
- Target bundle size: <200KB gzipped
- Time to interactive: <2s on 3G
- Lighthouse performance score: >90

## Phase 2: Figma Integration

### Goals
- Automate design token synchronization
- Enable direct component import from Figma
- Establish design-to-code pipeline

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement Figma API integration
- [ ] Build token extraction pipeline
- [ ] Create component mapping system
- [ ] Add design token validation
- [ ] Setup automated sync workflows

### Deliverables
- Figma plugin for token export
- CLI tool for token synchronization
- Updated documentation for designers

## Phase 3: Advanced Widget Features

### Goals
- Enhanced user interactions
- Multi-widget orchestration
- Advanced customization options

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement widget-to-widget communication
- [ ] Add multi-language support (i18n)
- [ ] Create widget analytics system
- [ ] Build advanced theming engine
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (WCAG AA)

### Features
- Cross-widget messaging bus
- Dynamic theme generation
- Usage analytics dashboard
- A11y compliance reporting

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

### Goals
- Enterprise-grade security
- Comprehensive testing
- Deployment automation

### Tasks
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Add end-to-end test coverage
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Build monitoring and alerting

### Infrastructure
- CDN distribution setup
- Version management system
- Rollback procedures
- Performance monitoring

## Ongoing Initiatives

### Documentation
- Maintain API documentation
- Update integration guides
- Create video tutorials
- Build example gallery

### Developer Experience
- Improve local development setup
- Add debugging tools
- Create development plugins
- Enhance error messages

### Community
- Open source selected components
- Create contributor guidelines
- Build partner ecosystem
- Establish support channels

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- Bundle size <200KB
- 95% test coverage
- <1% error rate
- <100ms API response time

### Business
- 10+ production deployments
- 5+ partner integrations
- 90% developer satisfaction
- <24hr support response time

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Browser compatibility issues → Comprehensive testing matrix
- Performance degradation → Continuous monitoring
- Security vulnerabilities → Regular audits

### Business Risks
- Adoption challenges → Clear documentation and examples
- Support burden → Self-service resources
- Feature creep → Strict prioritization framework

## Timeline

- **Q1 2025**: Phase 1 & 2 completion
- **Q2 2025**: Phase 3 development
- **Q3 2025**: Phase 4 & production launch
- **Q4 2025**: Scale and optimization

## Next Steps

1. Complete bundle optimization (Phase 1)
2. Begin Figma API integration research
3. Gather requirements for multi-widget support
4. Plan security audit scope
5. Define success metrics for Q1
